## Overview
Project Starfighter originally began as a one of my 'video game mechanic basics' exercises to write a flight simulator from scratch using Unity to experiment with implementing classic game mechanics as found in games like X-Wing or Rogue Squadron which had effective, but different implementations of a combat flight simulator. 


Over the years this also evolved to also be a 3D modeling exercise as I worked with designing my own ship models. The showcase models of this project are the Death Star Corridors and the Millennium Falcon (scaled exterior and interior). 


Much like the Enterprise VR project, this is a constantly evolving virtual reality project experimenting with VR interactions like flight simulations and first-person shooters as well as developing my own 3D models to balance real-time interactions.
