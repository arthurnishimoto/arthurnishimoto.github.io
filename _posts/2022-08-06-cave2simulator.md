  * [EVL Project Entry](https://www.evl.uic.edu/research/2165)


## Contribution Summary
  * Designed to abstract, simplify, and guide the development of CAVE2 applications to end-users without the need to focus on cluster management, synchronization (in some cases), and the getReal3D for Unity middleware.
  * Drag-and-drop prefabs for ease of integration from a Unity project to a CAVE2 ready project.
  * Custom PlayerController and simulator mode for developement.
  * Used by both CS and non-technical art students to develop projects since 2016.
