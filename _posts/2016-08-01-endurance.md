## Overview
NASA funded ENDURANCE (Environmentally Non-Disturbing Under-ice Robotic ANtarctiC Explorer) project deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of generating for the first time, 3-D bioÂ­geochemical datasets in the extreme environment of a perennially ice-covered Antarctic dry valley lake.


The AUV mapped the under-ice lake dimensions of West Lake Bonney in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and was equipped to measure temperature, electrical conductivity, ambient light, chlorophylla, Dissolved Organic Matter, pH and redox of the water column in the entire lake.


In collaboration with Dr. Peter Doran (Earth Science, UIC), Dr. William Stone (Stone Aerospace), Dr. Andrew Johnson (Computer Science, UIC), Dr. Bin Chen and Dr. Chris McKay (NASA Ames Research Center), and Dr. John Priscu (Land Resources and Environmental Sciences, Montana State University).


## Contribution Summary
 * Updated and maintained application developed in Omegalib (C++)
 * Parsed and cleaned up revised datasets
