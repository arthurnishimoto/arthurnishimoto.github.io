### Virtual UIC Architectural Study

(2017 - present) - Author/Lead Developer

Virtual Reality (CAVE2), Unity, C#, Blender, SketchUp, 3ds Max

<!--more--> 

## Overview
A real-time interactive architectural study of the Computer Design Research and Learning Center (CDRLC) a new Computer Science builing to be completed in 2023.


Funded by the College of Engineering, I cleaned up the original architectural SketchUp and AutoCAD 3D models provided by the architects in Blender to create more real-time friendly 3D models that could be imported into Unity for rendering.


## Contribution Summary
  * Imported, parsed, and cleaned up heavy architecural models in Blender for real-time use in Unity
  * Created Points of Interests highlighing building features based on architect designs
  * Imported or created additional models in Blender to fill out environment
  * Multiple versions of buildings for comparison or evaluation by VIPs


## Detailed Contribution

Using the pre-rendered images as a guide, I lit, textured, and set waypoints in the 3D model to highlight specific rooms and other features of the building. Over the course of a semester I worked on this application which eventually became a standard demo which was shown to a number of VIP guests including the Dean of the College of Engineeing and the President of the University of Illinois system.

Additional models were added to the application over time to prototype using virtual reality visualization as part of the workflow of UIC Captial Planning. This included a proposed classroom design where architects, administrators, and lecturers were brought into CAVE2 to evaluate the classroom design before the Academic and Residential Complex (ARC) had started construction.

The application also featured the Engineering Innovation Building (EIB) prior to its completion in 2019 as well as an early proposed design of the CS building.

I also created a custom building model of the [Science and Engineering Offices (SEO)](https://arthurnishimoto.blogspot.com/2015/10/uic-science-and-engineering-offices.html) to fill out campus details around the new CS building for context. I also modeling the SEO Memorial Grove based on the grounds plan.
