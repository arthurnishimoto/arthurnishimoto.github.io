## Overview
Over the past several years, the Enterprise VR project has been my main canvas for exploring 3D modeling and interactive design in virtual reality. Starting as just a side project after learning Blender and Unity from a computer animation class, the initial bridge model was an exploration into seeing where I could take those skills for general video game use.


With the construction of the CAVE2™ Hybrid-Reality Environment at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, the focus shifted from a standard video game to a accurately 1:1 scale virtual reality model of the bridge and later multiple decks within the Enterprise.


With the exception of  Eric "GuitarEC" Clark's Blender conversion of Dennis Bailey's refit Enterprise exterior model. All of the interior models were created by me using Blender. Based off of various studio floor plans, in-universe technical manuals, and screencaps from the films, I started creating several interior models and self-improving my modeling techniques as I progressed.


Beyond just a static model, the other major component was designing a fully interactive experience. Turbolift doors reacting to the user's head position, Kinect v2 speech recognition to interact with multiple parts of the environment from "initializing main energizer" to power on the bridge, red alert, shields up, turbolift direction, and running a series of cinematic sequences based on the films ("Clear all moorings", "thrusters at station keeping", "aft thrusters").
