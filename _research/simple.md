NASA funded SIMPLE (Sub-ice Investigation of Marine and Planetary-analog Ecosystems) project deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under the ice-covered lakes of Antarctica. Precursor to sending a similar AUV to Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa.
  - Successor mission to ENDURANCE.
  - Processed gigabytes of sensor logs, sonar readings, and images to develop a real-time virtual reality simulation of the AUV's mission under the lake. Developed applications for both Omegalib (C++) and Unity3D.
