## About
Currently a Research Assistant and PhD Candidate in Computer Science specializing in Virtual Realty, Human-Computer Interaction, and Scientific Visualization at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Since 2011, Arthur Nishimoto has worked with developing virtual reality applications for both scientific research and as a platform for viewing 3D artwork in an interactive environment.

Primarily using Blender and the Unity game engine, Arthur has developed numerous applications for EVL's CAVE2™ hybrid-reality environment, large tiled display walls, as well as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Quest/Quest 2, and Microsoft HoloLens/HoloLens2 head-mounted displays.

Also familiar with integrating various device APIs (Kinect, Vicon, Optitrack, PQLabs Touch, DirectInput/XInput) and socket networking code in C++, C#, and Java.

Will eventually have dedicated project pages for all these projects
```

* HummingbirdVR (2019 - present) - Lead Scientist/Developer
   - A networked, co-located multi-user virtual reality experience guided by a trained actor through a digital fairytale developed in a multi-disciplinary collaboration with directors, playwrights, scientists, and artists.
* CAVE2 Simulator (2013 - present) - Author
   - A Unity package of tutorials and examples for streamlining Unity application for deployment on EVL's CAVE2 Hybrid-Reality Environment - a 360-degree, 88 LCD stereoscopic display system powered by an 8-node computing cluster.
   - Used by both CS and non-technical art students to develop projects since 2016.
* Omicron (2011 - present) - Lead Developer
   - A C++ based input abstraction utility library to provide access to a wide variety of input devices for virtual reality and other immersive display systems
   - Integrated multiple device APIs such as OptiTrack, Vicon, Nintento Wii controllers, DirectInput/XInput controllers, Microsoft Kinect (skeleton and speech recognition), PQLabs multi-touch overlays, and Thinkgear brainwave.
   - Also provides a C++ server to stream device information over TCP/UDP sockets to C++, C#, Java, and Unity3D clients.
* Omegalib (2012 - 2017) - Major Contributer
   - A C++ middleware designed to streamline development applications for virtual reality and immersive display environments primarly targeting scientific visualization.
   - Supports mixed native (C++) or script-based (Python API) applications.
   - Integrates third party higher level toolkits like VTK, Open Scene Graph, and Qt.
  
## Research Projects
This section contains an overview of funded research projects I contributed to.

* CAVE2 (2012 - present) - Lead Developer
   - A 360-degree, 88 stereoscopic LCD display system powered by an 8-node computing cluster for virtual reality simulations and scientific visualizations.
   - Designed and maintains the 18 camera Vicon optical tracking system used with the Omicron Input Abstraction Library to provide tracking, controller, and other data to applications.
   - Designed the Unity-based CAVE2 Simulator and application template for projects developed since 2016.
   - Designed several applications from scientific visualization, architectual walkthroughs, games, and other simulations.

* UIC Virtual Campus (2017 - present) - Author

* MARS3 (2016 - 2017) - Contributing Scientist/Developer
   - A series of Unity-based physics games designed to aid in the recovery of post-stroke patients using a Kinect sensor to track upper body movements. In collaboration with the Chicago Shirley Ryan Ability Lab.
   - Refined the gameplay and physics interaction of the existing application.

* SIMPLE (2016 - 2018) - Lead Developer
   - NASA funded SIMPLE (Sub-ice Investigation of Marine and Planetary-analog Ecosystems) project deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under the ice-covered lakes of Antarctica. Precursor to sending a similar AUV to Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa.
   - Successor mission to ENDURANCE.
   - Processed gigabytes of sensor logs, sonar readings, and images to develop a real-time virtual reality simulation of the AUV's mission under the lake. Developed applications for both Omegalib (C++) and Unity3D.
 
* UofC Virtual Campus (2014 - 2017) - Lead Scientist/Developer
   - An experiment to push the limits of the Unity game engine to render high detail Building Information Modeling (BIM) models of several muilding on the University of Chicago campus and render it in real-time on EVL's CAVE2 virtual reality environment.
 
* ENDURANCE (2013 - 2016) - Contributing Scientist/Developer
   - NASA funded ENDURANCE (Environmentally Non-Disturbing Under-ice Robotic ANtarctiC Explorer) project deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under the ice-covered lakes of Antarctica. Precursor to sending a similar AUV to Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa.
   - Updated and maintained application developed in Omegalib (C++).

* SAGE, SAGE2, SAGE3 (2010 - present) - Contributing Scientist/Developer
